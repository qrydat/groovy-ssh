|===

Some settings can be set in global as follows.

[source,groovy]
----
ssh.settings {
  knownHosts = allowAnyHosts
  dryRun = true
}
----

Some settings can be overridden in a `ssh.run` method as follows.

[source,groovy]
----
ssh.run {
  settings {
    // overrides global settings
    pty = true
  }
  session(remotes.role('webServers')) {
    executeBackground('sudo service httpd reload')
  }
}
----

Some settings can be overridden in a remote host closure.

[source,groovy]
----
remotes {
  web01 {
    host = '192.168.1.101'
    user = 'jenkins'
    identity = file('id_rsa_jenkins')
    // overrides global settings
    agentForwarding = true
  }
}
----

Some settings can be overridden on an operation method.

[source,groovy]
----
execute('sudo service httpd reload', pty: false)
execute('sudo service httpd reload', logging: false)
----


== Manage remote hosts

The plugin adds a container of remote hosts to the project.


=== Add a remote host

Following code adds a remote host to the remote hosts container:

[source,groovy]
----
remotes {
  web01 {
    host = '192.168.1.101'
    user = 'jenkins'
  }
}
----

A remote host can be added by calling `remotes.create(name)`.

[source,groovy]
----
task setupRemote << {
  ssh.run {
    session(remotes.web01) {
      def targetHost = execute 'cat settings/hostname'
      def targetUser = execute 'cat settings/username'
      // Create and add a remote host
      remotes.create('db01') {
        host = targetHost
        user = targetUser
      }
    }
  }
}

task something(dependsOn: setupRemote) << {
  ssh.run {
    session(remotes.db01) {
      //execute ...
    }
  }
}
----

Following settings can be set in a remote closure.

.Remote settings
[options="header,autowidth"]
|===
|Key |Type |Description

|`host`
|`String`, Mandatory
|Hostname or IP address of the remote host.

|`port`
|`int`
|Port. Defaults to port 22.
|===


==== Set connection settings

Also following settings can be set in a remote closure.

.Connection settings
[options="header,autowidth"]
|===
|Key |Type |Description

|`user`
|`String`, Mandatory
|User name.

|`password`
|`String`
|Password for password authentication. Defaults to no password authentication.

|`identity`
|`File` or `String`
|Private key for public-key authentication. Defaults to no public-key authentication.

|`passphrase`
|`String`
|Pass-phrase of the private key. Defaults to no pass-phrase.

|`authentications`
|`List<String>`
|Authentication methods in order. Defaults to `publickey`, `keyboard-interactive` and `password`.

|`proxy`
|`Proxy`
|Proxy server. If this is set, the proxy server is used to reach the remote host. Defaults to no proxy.

|`gateway`
|`Remote`
|Gateway remote host. If this is set, the port-forwarding tunnel is used to reach the remote host. Defaults to no gateway.

|`agent`
|`boolean`
|If this is `true`, Putty Agent or ssh-agent is used on authentication. Defaults to `false`.

|`knownHosts`
|`File` or `List<File>`
|One or more known hosts files. Defaults to `new File("${System.properties['user.home']}/.ssh/known_hosts")`. If `allowAnyHosts` is set, strict host key checking is turned off (vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks).

|`timeoutSec`
|`int` (seconds)
|Both connection timeout and socket read timeout. Defaults to 0 (OS default).

|`retryCount`
|`int`
|Retry count to establish connection. Defaults to 0 (no retry).

|`retryWaitSec`
|`int` (seconds)
|Interval time between each retries. Defaults to 0 (immediately).

|`keepAliveSec`
|`int` (seconds)
|Interval time of keep alive messages sent to the remote host. Defaults to 60 seconds.
|===

Note that `identity` can be a `File` or `String`.
If a `String` is set, it is treated as a content of the private key but not a path.

[source,groovy]
----
ssh.settings {
  // path to the private key
  identity = new File('id_rsa')

  // content of the private key
  identity = """-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
BASE64ENCODEDKEY...
------END RSA PRIVATE KEY-------"""
}
----

These can be set globally in the project as follows.

[source,groovy]
----
ssh.settings {
  knownHosts = allowAnyHosts
}
----


==== Connect through gateway servers

A remote host can be connected through one or more gateway servers.

===== Through one gateway

[source,groovy]
----
remotes {
  Gateway {
    host = '10.2.3.4'
    user = 'gwuser'
  }
  Target {
    host = '192.168.1.101'
    user = 'jenkins'
    gateway = remotes.Gateway
  }
}
----

It will:

. connect to Gateway (`10.2.3.4`) and tunnel from an auto-allocated port (`127.0.0.1:X`) to Target (`192.168.1.101`).
. connect to the tunnelled port (`127.0.0.1:X`) and perform operations.

If strict host key checking is turned on,

. `known_hosts` of Gateway should contain `10.2.3.4` with the host key of Gateway.
. `known_hosts` of Target should contain `192.168.1.101` with the host key of Target.


===== Through two-hop gateways

[source,groovy]
----
remotes {
  FrontGateway {
    host = '10.2.3.4'
    user = 'frontgwuser'
  }
  MidGateway {
    host = '172.16.1.2'
    user = 'gwuser'
    gateway = remotes.FrontGateway
  }
  Target {
    host = '192.168.1.101'
    user = 'jenkins'
    gateway = remotes.MidGateway
  }
}
----

It will:

. connect to FrontGateway (`10.2.3.4`) and tunnel from an auto-allocated port (`127.0.0.1:X`) to MidGateway (`172.16.1.2`).
. connect to the tunnelled port (`127.0.0.1:X`) and tunnel from an auto-allocated port (`127.0.0.1:Y`) to Target (`192.168.1.101`).
. connect to the tunnelled port (`127.0.0.1:Y`) and perform operations.

If strict host key checking is turned on,

. `known_hosts` of FrontGateway should contain `10.2.3.4` with the host key with FrontGateway.
. `known_hosts` of MidGateway should contain `172.16.1.2` with the host key with MidGateway.
. `known_hosts` of Target should contain `192.168.1.101` with the host key with Target.


==== Connect through a proxy server

A remote host can specify that connections should be made through a proxy server.
Individual proxy server connections are configured in the `proxies` container provided by the plugin.

The following code adds a proxy server to the `proxies` container:

[source,groovy]
----
proxies {
  socks01 {
    host = '192.168.1.112'
    port = 1080
    type = SOCKS
  }
}
----

The following settings are used to configure how a proxied connection is established within a proxy closure.

.Proxy settings
[options="header,autowidth"]
|===
|Key |Type |Description

|`host`
|`String`, Mandatory
|Hostname or IP address of the proxy server.

|`port`
|`int`, Mandatory
|Port of the proxy server.

|`type`
|`String` or `ProxyType`, Mandatory
|Type of the proxy server: `SOCKS` or `HTTP`.

|`user`
|`String`
|User name of the proxy server.

|`password`
|`String`
|Password of the proxy server.

|`socksVersion`
|`int`
|Protocol version when using `SOCKS`: 4 or 5. Defaults to 5.
|===

Once a proxy server is defined in the `proxies` container,
it can be referenced per-remote, per-method or globally.
Unless the remote's proxy property is set in a higher scope, connections made to that host will not be proxied.

The following code shows how remote hosts can use different proxy servers.

[source,groovy]
----
proxies {
  socks {
    host = '192.168.1.112'
    port = 1080
    user = 'admin'
    password = '0t1s'
    type = SOCKS
    socksVersion = 5
  }

  http {
    host = '192.168.1.113'
    port = 8080
    type = HTTP
  }
}

remotes {
  web01 {
    host = '192.168.1.101'
    user = 'jenkins'
    proxy = proxies.http
  }

  web02 {
    host = '192.168.1.102'
    user = 'jenkins'
    proxy = proxies.socks
  }
}
----

The following shows how to set a global proxy server.

[source,groovy]
----
ssh.settings {
  // All remotes will use this proxy by default.
  // Each remote can override this configuration.
  proxy = proxies.socks01
}
----

The following shows how to set a proxy server on a particular method.

[source,groovy]
----
task jarSearch << {
  ssh.run {
    settings {
      proxy = proxies.http01
    }
    session(remotes.role('mavenRepo')) { ... }
  }
}
----


=== Associate with roles

Call `role` method to associate the host with one or more roles.

[source,groovy]
----
remotes {
  web01 {
    role('webServers')
    role('servers')
    host = '192.168.1.101'
    user = 'jenkins'
  }
}
----

We can specify one or mote roles on a session.

[source,groovy]
----
// remote hosts associated to servers
session(remotes.role('servers')) {
}

// remote hosts associated to webServer OR appServer
session(remotes.role('webServer', 'appServer')) {
}

// remote hosts associated to webServer AND appServer
session(remotes.allRoles('webServer', 'appServer')) {
}
----

=== Remote host container

Implementation of the remote hosts container is different between Gradle SSH Plugin and Groovy SSH.

Gradle SSH plugin::
The remote hosts container is a http://www.gradle.org/docs/current/javadoc/org/gradle/api/NamedDomainObjectContainer.html[NamedDomainObjectContainer] provided by Gradle API.
It also has role filter methods.

Groovy SSH::
The remote hosts container is a `Map<String, Remote>`.
It also has some of `Collection` methods and role filter methods.

The remote hosts container supports following methods and almost code should work on both Gradle SSH Plugin and Groovy SSH.

* `add(Remote)`
* `addAll(Collection<Remote>)`
* `create(String, Closure)`
* `role(String...)`
* `allRoles(String...)`


== Add sessions

`ssh.run` method connects to all remote hosts and evaluates each closure of sessions in order.
For example of following, the method connects to `web01` and `web02`, and executes `command1` and `command2`.

[source,groovy]
----
ssh.run {
  session(remotes.web01) {
    execute 'command1'
  }
  session(remotes.web02) {
    execute 'command2'
  }
}
----


=== Session settings

Following settings can be set in global:

.Session settings
[options="header,autowidth"]
|===
|Key |Type |Description

|`dryRun`
|`boolean`
|If this is `true`, no actual connection or operation will be performed. Defaults to `false`.

|`jschLog`
|`boolean`
|If this is `true`, JSch verbose log is shown. Defaults to `false`.

|`extensions`
|`List` of `Trait` or `Map`
|DSL extensions. Defaults to an empty list.
|===


=== Obtain the result of session

`ssh.run` method will return the result of last declared session.
So we can use the method to retrieve a result of remote command as like:

[source,groovy]
----
task syncKernelParam << {
  def paramKey = 'net.core.wmem_max'
  def paramValue = ssh.run {
    session(remotes.web01) {
      execute("sysctl '$paramKey' | sed -e 's/ //g'")
    }
  }
  assert paramValue.contains(paramKey)
  ssh.run {
    session(remotes.web02) {
      execute("sysctl -w '$paramValue'")
    }
  }
}
----


=== More about sessions

A session consists of a remote host to connect and a closure.
Following code declares a session which connects to _web01_ and executes a command.

[source,groovy]
----
session(remotes.web01) {
  //execute ...
}
----

If more than one remote hosts are given, the plugin will connect to all remote hosts at once and execute closures in order.
For instance, followings are all equivalent.

[source,groovy]
----
session([remotes.web01, remotes.web02]) {
  //execute ...
}
----

[source,groovy]
----
session(remotes.web01, remotes.web02) {
  //execute ...
}
----

[source,groovy]
----
session(remotes.web01) {
  //execute ...
}
session(remotes.web02) {
  //execute ...
}
----

`session` method also accepts a map of settings of the remote host.

[source,groovy]
----
session(name: 'web01', host: '192.168.1.101', user: 'jenkins', identity: file('id_rsa')) {
  //execute ...
}

// If name is not given, auto-generated name such as Remote1 will be shown in console log
session(host: '192.168.1.101', user: 'jenkins', identity: file('id_rsa')) {
  //execute ...
}
----


== Perform operations

Following methods are available in a session closure.

* `execute` - Execute a command.
* `executeBackground` - Execute a command in background.
* `executeSudo` - Execute a command with sudo prompt support.
* `shell` - Execute a shell.
* `put` - Put a file or directory into the remote host.
* `get` - Get a file or directory from the remote host.
* `remove` - Remove a file or directory on the remote host.


=== Execute a command

Call the `execute` method with a command to execute.

[source,groovy]
----
execute 'sudo service httpd reload'

// with settings
execute 'sudo service httpd reload', pty: true
----

The method escapes command arguments if a list of strings is given.

[source,groovy]
----
execute(['perl', '-e', /print 'current: ', time, "\n"/])
----

The method waits until the command is completed and returns a result from standard output of the command.
Line separators are converted to the platform native.

[source,groovy]
----
def result = execute 'uname -a'
println result
----

A result can be retrieved as an argument if a closure is given.

[source,groovy]
----
execute('uname -a') { result ->
  println result
}
----

The method accepts following settings:

.Command settings
[options="header,autowidth"]
|===
|Key |Type |Description

|`ignoreError`
|`boolean`
|If this is `true`, an exit status of the command or shell is ignored. Defaults to `false`.

|`pty`
|`boolean`
|If this is `true`, a PTY (pseudo-terminal) is allocated on the command execution. Defaults to `false`.

|`agentForwarding`
|`boolean`
|If this is `true`, the agent forwarding is requested on the command execution. Defaults to `false`.

|`logging`
|`String` or `LoggingMethod`
|If this is `slf4j`, console log of the remote command is sent to Gradle logger.
 If this is `stdout`, it is sent to standard output and error.
 If this is `none`, console logging is turned off.
 Defaults to `slf4j`.

|`inputStream`
|`InputStream`, `byte[]` or `String`
|An input data to sent to the standard input of remote command. Defaults to null.

|`outputStream`
|`OutputStream`
|An output stream to receive from the standard output of remote command. Defaults to null.

|`errorStream`
|`OutputStream`
|An output stream to receive from the standard error of remote command. Defaults to null.

|`encoding`
|`String`
|Encoding of input and output on the command or shell execution. Defaults to `UTF-8`.

|`interaction`
|`Closure`
|Closure of interaction with the stream on the command or shell execution. Defaults to no interaction.
|===

The method throws an exception if an exit status of the command was not zero. It can be ignored if the `ignoreError` setting is given as follow:

[source,groovy]
----
execute 'exit 1', ignoreError: true
----


=== Execute a command in background

Call the `executeBackground` method with a command to execute in background.

[source,groovy]
----
executeBackground 'sudo service httpd reload'

// with settings
executeBackground 'sudo service httpd reload', pty: true
----

The method does not wait for the command.
Other commands are executed concurrently.

[source,groovy]
----
// httpd processes on all web servers will be reloaded concurrently
session(remotes.role('webServers')) {
  executeBackground 'sudo service httpd reload'
}

// ping to many hosts concurrently
session(remotes.web01) {
  (1..127).each { lastOctet ->
    executeBackground "ping -c 1 -w 1 192.168.1.$lastOctet"
  }
}
----

The method escapes command arguments if a list of strings is given.

[source,groovy]
----
executeBackground(['perl', '-e', /print 'current: ', time, "\n"/])
----

A result can be retrieved as an argument if a closure is given.

[source,groovy]
----
executeBackground('ping -c 3 server') { result ->
  def average = result.find('min/avg/.+=.+?/.+?/').split('/')[-1]
}
----

The method accepts settings same as `execute` method.

The method throws an exception if an exit status of the command is not zero.
If a background command returned an error, `ssh.run` method waits for any other commands and throws an exception finally.

It ignores the exit status if the `ignoreError` setting is given as follow:

[source,groovy]
----
executeBackground 'exit 1', ignoreError: true
----


=== Execute a command with the sudo prompt support

Call the `executeSudo` method with a command to execute with the sudo support.
The method prepends `sudo -S -p` to the command and will provide the password for sudo prompt.

[source,groovy]
----
executeSudo 'service httpd reload'

// also can be called with settings
executeSudo 'service httpd reload', pty: true
----

The method waits until the command is completed and returns a result from standard output of the command, excluding sudo interactions.
Line separators are converted to the platform native.

[source,groovy]
----
def result = executeSudo 'service httpd status'
println result
----

The method escapes command arguments if a list of strings is given.

[source,groovy]
----
executeSudo(['perl', '-e', /print 'current: ', time, "\n"/])
----

A result can be retrieved as an argument if a closure is given.

[source,groovy]
----
executeSudo('service httpd status') { result ->
  println result
}
----

The method accepts following settings and settings same as `execute` method.

.Sudo settings
[options="header,autowidth"]
|===
|Key |Type |Description

|`sudoPassword`
|String
|Password provided for the sudo prompt. Defaults to `password` of the remote host.

|`sudoPath`
|String
|Path to sudo executable. Defaults to `sudo`.
|===

The method throws an exception if an exit status of the command was not zero, including the sudo authentication failure. Also the `ignoreError` setting is supported.

The sudo support is achieved by the stream interaction support. So the method does not accept an `interaction` setting.


=== Execute a shell

Call the `shell` method to execute a shell.
The method is useful for a limited environment which supports only a shell such as Cisco IOS.

An `interaction` setting should be given in order to exit the shell.

[source,groovy]
----
session(remotes.web01) {
  shell interaction: {
    when(partial: ~/.*$/) {
      standardInput << 'exit 0' << '\n'
    }
  }
}
----

The method accepts following settings:

.Shell settings
[options="header,autowidth"]
|===
|Key |Type |Description

|`ignoreError`
|`boolean`
|If this is `true`, an exit status of the command or shell is ignored. Defaults to `false`.

|`pty`
|`boolean`
|If this is `true`, a PTY (pseudo-terminal) is allocated on the command execution. Defaults to `false`.

|`agentForwarding`
|`boolean`
|If this is `true`, the agent forwarding is requested on the command execution. Defaults to `false`.

|`logging`
|`String` or `LoggingMethod`
|If this is `slf4j`, console log of the remote command is sent to Gradle logger.
 If this is `stdout`, it is sent to standard output and error.
 If this is `none`, console logging is turned off.
 Defaults to `slf4j`.

|`inputStream`
|`InputStream`, `byte[]` or `String`
|An input data to sent to the standard input of remote command. Defaults to null.

|`outputStream`
|`OutputStream`
|An output stream to receive from the standard output of remote command. Defaults to null.

|`encoding`
|`String`
|Encoding of input and output on the command or shell execution. Defaults to `UTF-8`.

|`interaction`
|`Closure`
|Closure of interaction with the stream on the command or shell execution. Defaults to no interaction.
|===

The method throws an exception if an exit status of the shell was not zero. It can be ignored if the `ignoreError` setting is given as follow:

[source,groovy]
----
shell ignoreError: true, interaction: {...}
----


=== Transfer a file or directory

Call the `get` method to get a file or directory from the remote host.

[source,groovy]
----
// specify a file path
get from: '/remote/file', into: 'local_file'

// specify a file object
get from: '/remote/file', into: buildDir

// specify a file object with file filter
get from: '/remote/folder', into: buildDir, filter: { it.name =~ /\.xml$/ }

// specify an output stream
file.withOutputStream { stream ->
  get from: '/remote/file', into: stream
}

// get content as a string
def text = get from: '/remote/file'
----

Call the `put` method to put a file or directory into the remote host.
It also accepts content such as a string or byte array.

[source,groovy]
----
// specify a file path
put from: 'local_file', into: '/remote/file'

// specify a file object
put from: file('fixture.dat'), into: '/remote/folder'

// specify an input stream
file.withInputStream { stream ->
  put from: stream, into: '/remote/file.txt'
}

// specify a string
put text: '''#!/bin/sh
echo 'hello world'
''', into: '/remote/script.sh'

// specify a byte array
put bytes: [0xff, 0xff], into: '/remote/fixture.dat'

// specify files
put from: files('local_file1', 'local_file2'), into: '/remote/folder'

// specify a directory
put from: buildDir, into: '/remote/folder'

// specify a directory with file filter
put from: buildDir, into: '/remote/folder', filter: { it.name =~ /\.xml$/ }
----

These methods throw an exception if an error occurred while the file transfer.

Following settings can be set in global, per-method or per-remote.

.File transfer settings
[options="header,autowidth"]
|===
|Key |Type |Description

|`fileTransfer`
|`String` or `FileTransferMethod`
|File transfer method, that is `sftp` or `scp`. Defaults to `sftp`.
|===

If a filter closure is given, it will be called with an each file.
A filter closure should return boolean to determine to transfer or not.

[NOTE]
.Difference of handling empty directories if a filter closure is given or not

If a file filter is given, only matched files excluding empty directories will be transferred.
Otherwise, all files including empty directories will be transferred.

Let's see the example.
It assumes the local host have following files and directories.

----
/dir1
  /dir2
    /file2.txt
    /dir3
      /file3.xml
      /dir4
----

If no filter is given, all files and directories (same as above) will be transferred.

If the filter `{ it.name =~ /\.txt$/ }` is given, following files and directories will be transferred.

----
/dir1
  /dir2
    /file2.txt
----

If the filter `{ it.name =~ /\.xml$/ }` is given, following files and directories will be transferred.

----
/dir1
  /dir2
    /dir3
      /file3.xml
----

If the filter `{ it.name =~ /\.dat$/ }` is given, nothing will be transferred.

====


=== Remove a file or directory

Call the `remove` method to remove a file or directory on the remote host.
It accepts 2 or more paths.

[source,groovy]
----
// specify a file
remove '/remote/file'

// specify a directory to remove recursively
remove '/remote/directory'

// specify more paths
remove '/remote/file', '/remote/directory'
----

The method returns `true` if anything is removed, `false` if nothing is removed.
It throws an exception if an error occurred.


=== Enable the port forwarding

Call the `forwardLocalPort` method to forward a local port to a remote port.

[source,groovy]
----
// Forward localhost:18080 to remote:8080
forwardLocalPort port: 18080, hostPort: 8080

// Forward localhost:(allocated port) to remote:8080
int port = forwardLocalPort hostPort: 8080

// Forward localhost:18080 to 172.16.1.1:8080
forwardLocalPort port: 18080, host: '172.16.1.1', hostPort: 8080

// Forward *:18080 (listen to all) to 172.16.1.1:8080
forwardLocalPort bind: '0.0.0.0', port: 18080, host: '172.16.1.1', hostPort: 8080
----

The method accepts following settings:

.Local port forwarding settings
[options="header,autowidth"]
|===
|Key |Type |Description

|`port`
|`int`
|Local port to bind. Defaults to 0 (automatically allocated a free port).

|`bind`
|`String`
|Local address to bind. Defaults to `localhost`.

|`hostPort`
|`int`, Mandatory
|Remote port to connect.

|`host`
|`String`
|Remote address to connect. Default to `localhost` of the remote host.
|===


Call the `forwardRemotePort` method to forward a local port to a remote port.

[source,groovy]
----
// Forward remote:30000 to localhost:8080
forwardRemotePort port: 30000, hostPort: 8080

// Forward remote:30000 to 192.168.1.5:8080
forwardRemotePort port: 30000, host: '192.168.1.5', hostPort: 8080

// Forward remote:30000 (listen to all) to 192.168.1.5:8080
forwardRemotePort bind: '0.0.0.0', port: 30000, host: '192.168.1.5', hostPort: 8080
----

The method accepts following settings:

.Remote port forwarding settings
[options="header,autowidth"]
|===
|Key |Type |Description

|`port`
|`int`, Mandatory
|Remote port to bind.

|`bind`
|`String`
|Remote address to bind. Defaults to `localhost` of the remote host.

|`hostPort`
|`int`, Mandatory
|Local port to connect.

|`host`
|`String`
|Local address to connect. Default to `localhost`.
|===

The port forwarding is valid until all sessions are finished.
So we can connect to a server via a tunnel in the `ssh.run` method.

[source,groovy]
----
import groovyx.net.http.RESTClient

ssh.run {
  session(remotes.web01) {
    forwardLocalPort port: 8080, hostPort: 8080

    // access to the HTTP server via the tunnel
    new RESTClient('http://localhost:8080').get(path: '/')
  }
}
----


=== Stream interaction support

The execute method can interact with the stream of command executed on the remote host.
The shell method can do same.
This feature is useful for providing a password or yes/no answer.


==== Declare interaction rules

Call the execute or shell method with an `interaction` setting which contains one or more interaction rules.
Interaction rules will be evaluated in order.
If any rule has been matched, others are not evaluated more.

The following example declares 2 rules.

[source,groovy]
----
interaction: {
  when(/* pattern match A */) {
    /* action closure A */
  }

  when(/* pattern match B */) {
    /* action closure B */
  }
}
----

If the pattern A is matched, the closure A is executed.
If the pattern A is not matched and the pattern B is matched, the closure B is executed.
If neither the pattern A nor B are matched, nothing is done.


==== An interaction rule is

An interaction rule consists of a pattern match and an action closure.
The action closure will be executed if the pattern match is satisfied.


===== Pattern match

A pattern match is one of the following.

* `when(partial: pattern, from: stream)`
  Declares if a string received from the stream is matched to the pattern.
* `when(line: pattern, from: stream)`
  Declares if a line received from the stream is matched to the pattern.

The pattern is one of the following.

* If the pattern is a string, it performs exact match.
* If the pattern is a regular expression, it performs regular expression match. Groovy provides pretty notation such as `~/pattern/`.
* If the pattern is `_`, it matches to any line even if empty.

The stream is one of the following.

* `standardOutput` - Standard output of the command.
* `standardError` - Standard error of the command.
* `_` - Any.
* If the stream is omitted, it means any.


===== Action closure

An action closure is a generic Groovy closure executed if the pattern match is satisfied.
It can write a string to the `standardInput`.

[source,groovy]
----
interaction: {
  when(partial: ~/.*#/) {
    standardInput << 'exit' << '\n'
  }
}
----

An action closure can get the match result by the first argument.

* If the pattern is a string, a string is passed.
* If the pattern is a regular expression, a `java.util.regex.Matcher` is passed.
* If the pattern is `_`, a string is passed.

Following example shows all lines of the standard error.

[source,groovy]
----
interaction: {
  when(line: _, from: standardError) { line ->
    println line
  }
}
----

An action closure can contain one or more interaction rules.
If so, surrounding rules are discarded and inner rules are activated.

[source,groovy]
----
interaction: {
  when(/* rule A */) {
    when(/* rule C */) {
    }
  }
  when(/* rule B */) {
  }
}
----

In the above example, at first, rule A and B are active.
If rule A has been matched, rule A and B are discarded and rule C is active now.


==== Context stack

Interaction rules are stored into the context stack for nesting.

If an action closure contains no `when()`, the stack is kept as-is.
If an action closure contains one or more `when()`s, the stack is pushed and inner rules are active.
If an action closure contains `popContext()`, the stack is popped and outer rules are active.

Let's see the example.

[source,groovy]
----
interaction: {
  when(/* rule A */) {
    when(/* rule C */) {
      when(/* rule E */) {
        popContext()
      }
      when(/* rule F */) {
      }
    }
    when(/* rule D */) {
    }
  }
  when(/* rule B */) {
  }
}
----

At first, the stack is following.

----
[ruleA, ruleB]      <- stack top
----

If rule A is matched, rule C and D are pushed into the stack.

----
[ruleC, ruleD]      <- stack top
[ruleA, ruleB]
----

If rule C is matched, rule E and F are pushed into the stack.

----
[ruleE, ruleF]      <- stack top
[ruleC, ruleD]
[ruleA, ruleB]
----

If rule E is matched, the stack is popped and rule C and D are active.

----
[ruleC, ruleD]      <- stack top
[ruleA, ruleB]
----


==== Example: handle the prompt

Let's take a look at the following example.

[source,groovy]
----
shell interaction: {  //<1>
  when(partial: ~/.*$/) {  //<2>
    standardInput << 'exit 0' << '\n'  //<3>
  }
}
----

<1> Execute a shell with the interaction support
<2> Declare a rule if the stream gives a string terminated with `$`
<3> If the rule is matched, provides the exit to the shell

It executes a shell and provides `exit 0` if the prompt appears.


==== Example: handle more prompts

This example executes `passwd` command to change the password of login user.

[source,groovy]
----
execute('passwd', pty: true, interaction: {  //<1>
  when(partial: ~/.+[Pp]assowrd: */) {  //<2>
    standardInput << oldPassword << '\n'  //<3>
    when(partial: ~/.+[Pp]assowrd: */) {  //<4>
      standardInput << newPassword << '\n'  //<5>
    }
  }
  when(line: _) { line ->  //<6>
    throw new IllegalStateException("passwd command returned error: $line")
  }
})
----

<1> Execute `passwd` command with the stream interaction.
<2> If the first password prompt is received,
<3> Provide the old password.
<4> If the second or more password prompt is received,
<5> Provide the new password.
<6> If the command did not return the password prompt, throw an exception.


== DSL extension system

We can extend DSL vocabulary using the extension system.
This feature is still experimental and may be improved in the future.

=== Start from a simple extension

Add a map to `extension` of the global settings.
Following example adds the method `restartAppServer` and it is available in the session closure.

[source,groovy]
----
ssh.settings {
  extensions.add restartAppServer: {
    execute 'sudo service tomcat restart'
  }
}

ssh.run {
  session(ssh.remotes.testServer) {
    restartAppServer()
  }
}
----

=== Use Gradle feature in an extension

We can use project properties such as configurations and dependencies from the extension.
Following example transfers the `groovy-all` jar and execute a script on the remote host.

[source,groovy]
----
repositories {
  jcenter()
}

configurations {
  groovyRuntime
}

dependencies {
  groovyRuntime 'org.codehaus.groovy:groovy-all:2.3.9'
}

ssh.settings {
  /**
   * Execute a Groovy script on the remote host.
   * Groovy dependency must be set as the configuration groovyRuntime.
   */
  extensions.add executeGroovyScript: { String script ->
    def temporaryPath = "/tmp/${UUID.randomUUID()}"
    try {
      execute "mkdir -vp $temporaryPath"
      put from: project.configurations.groovyRuntime, into: temporaryPath
      put text: script, into: "$temporaryPath/script.groovy"
      execute "java -jar $temporaryPath/groovy-all-*.jar $temporaryPath/script.groovy"
    } finally {
      execute "rm -vfr $temporaryPath"
    }
  }
}

task example << {
  ssh.run {
    session(remotes.webServer) {
      // Execute a script on the remote host
      executeGroovyScript 'println GroovySystem.version'
    }
  }
}
----

=== Alternative: Trait based extension

Create an extension trait in the `buildSrc/src/main/groovy` directory.

[source,groovy]
----
// buildSrc/src/main/groovy/extensions.groovy
trait RemoteFileExtension {
  void eachFile(String directory, Closure closure) {
    sftp {
      ls(directory).each(closure)
    }
  }
}
----

Properties and methods in the trait are available in the session closure.

[source,groovy]
----
// build.gradle
ssh.run {
  settings {
    extensions.add RemoteFileExtension
  }
  session(remotes.localhost) {
    eachFile('/webapps') {
      println it.filename
    }
  }
}
----

An extension trait must be placed in the `buildSrc/src/main/groovy` directory.
